# API Standardization Progress

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Interpolation Framework
- Created `AbstractInterpolator` abstract type
- Updated existing interpolators to inherit from this type:
  - `AAADapprox` for AAA rational approximation
  - `FHDapprox` for Floater-Hormann interpolation 
  - `GPRapprox` for Gaussian Process Regression
  - `FourierSeries` for Fourier series approximation
- Added methods to ensure all interpolator types work with the derivative calculation code
- Exported the interpolator types and functions for consistent usage
- Verified functionality with basic test case

### 2. Function Type Annotations
- Added explicit return type annotations to:
  - `nth_deriv_at` and related functions
  - `create_interpolants` 
  - `convert_to_real_or_complex_array`
  - `lookup_value`
- Made some parameter type annotations less restrictive to maintain compatibility

### 3. Documentation
- Added comprehensive docstrings to key functions
- Standardized docstring format across functions
- Added parameter type annotations in docstrings

### 4. Naming Standardization
- Standardized tolerance parameter names (`reltol`/`abstol`)
- Standardized interpolator parameter names

## In Progress

### 1. Core Type Definitions
- Improved some type annotations in:
  - `ParameterEstimationProblem`
  - `ParameterEstimationResult`
  - `DerivativeData`
- Need to balance better type specs with maintaining backwards compatibility

### 2. Function Parameters
- Standardized some function signatures
- Still need to harmonize parameter orders across related functions

## Next Steps

### 1. Incremental Type Stabilization
- Create test cases for key functions
- Add more type annotations incrementally, with testing after each change
- Focus on numerical functions that would benefit most from type stability

### 2. Full API Review
- Review consistent parameter ordering across functions
- Ensure consistent naming patterns  
- Update remaining functions to follow the standardized patterns

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Identify bottlenecks using profiling
- Add `@inbounds` to performance-critical loops
- Add `@inline` to small, frequently called functions
- Consider specialized algorithms for common cases

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental Approach**: Making changes incrementally with testing between steps is essential for maintaining compatibility.

2. **Type Flexibility**: Sometimes using more general types (or Union types) is necessary for compatibility with existing code.

3. **Documentation Impact**: Even when full type stabilization isn't possible, adding complete documentation improves code understanding and maintainability.

4. **Interface Consistency**: Creating consistent interfaces (like the AbstractInterpolator pattern) helps standardize code structure even when internal implementations vary.
