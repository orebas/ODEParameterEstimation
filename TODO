rewrite output:  
	show which vars are globally unident
	for each output set, show map from var to value, including what was used for global subst
	show error (to sample data)
	optional:  compare each output param value to input param value if supplied


implement multiple point method
produce overdetermind equations from multiple point
add tests against SI.jl (local vs structural identifiability)
test  all examples from SI.jl, and whatever other sources are available
add newton or other polisher to increase precision (perhaps using SCIML optimizers)
add support for big float, make sure we support complex valued ODEs, and in general make more type agnostic
    -may not work because HomotopyContinuation doesn't support most of these
test solving with monodromy

add tests with longer time periods, and oscillatory ODEs
check max derivative calculuation
add tests for stiff diffeqs, and support stiff diffeqs generally
get ratioanl functions working properly
