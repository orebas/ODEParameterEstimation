add tests against SI.jl (local vs structural identifiability)
test  all examples from SI.jl, and whatever other sources are available
add newton or other polisher to increase precision (perhaps using SCIML optimizers)
add support for big float, make sure we support complex valued ODEs, and in general make more type agnostic
    -may not work because HomotopyContinuation doesn't support most of these
add tests with longer time periods, and oscillatory ODEs
check max derivative calculuation
add tests for stiff diffeqs, and support stiff diffeqs generally
