# ODEParameterEstimation.jl Refactoring Progress

## Completed Changes

### 1. Added Proper Logging System
- Created `logging_utils.jl` with helper functions for logging
- Added configuration function for setting log levels
- Added specialized logging functions for matrices, equations, and dictionaries
- Environment variable `ODEPE_DEBUG` controls default log level
- Started replacing print statements with `@debug` macros
- Added Logging as an explicit dependency in Project.toml

### 2. Extracted Helper Functions for Derivatives
- Created `derivative_utils.jl` with helper functions for calculating derivatives
- Implemented `calculate_higher_derivatives` for handling equation derivatives
- Implemented `calculate_higher_derivative_terms` for LHS/RHS term derivatives
- These functions eliminate repeated code patterns in the codebase

### 3. Refactored Large Functions
- Split 270+ line `multipoint_parameter_estimation` into three focused functions:
  - `setup_parameter_estimation`: Handles setup and configuration (65 lines)
  - `solve_parameter_estimation`: Handles system construction and solution (60 lines)
  - `process_estimation_results`: Handles result processing (135 lines)
- Created a new simplified `multipoint_parameter_estimation` that uses these helpers (65 lines)
- Moved `multishot_parameter_estimation` to the same file for better organization
- Added `log_diagnostic_info` helper for diagnostic output (100 lines)
- Created new file structure for better organization
- Fixed method overwriting issues and dependency problems
- Ensured all functions are properly exported

### 4. Added Tests
- Created tests for model utilities (`test_model_utils.jl`)
- Created tests for math utilities (`test_math_utils.jl`)
- Created tests for core types (`test_core_types.jl`)
- Created tests for derivative utilities (`test_derivative_utils.jl`)
- Created tests for multipoint estimation (`test_multipoint_estimation.jl`)

## Next Steps

### 1. Continue Replacing Debug Prints
- Identify and replace remaining debug print statements with logging macros
- Add context to log messages to make them more informative

### 2. Refactor Remaining Large Functions
- Split `solve_with_rs` into smaller functions:
  - Preparation function
  - Solution function
  - Result processing function
- Apply the same pattern to `solve_with_hc` and `solve_with_monodromy`

### 3. Standardize APIs and Naming
- Standardize parameter types with explicit type annotations
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
- Add missing type annotations to function signatures

### 4. Further File Reorganization
- Reorganize `derivatives.jl` by splitting it into:
  - `interpolation.jl`: Interpolation methods
  - `derivatives.jl`: Core derivative calculation logic
  - `approximation.jl`: Approximation methods

## Testing Status
- We have created basic unit tests for the core utilities
- More comprehensive tests will be added as the refactoring progresses
