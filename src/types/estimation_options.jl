	EstimationOptions(; options...)

Everything that can be adjusted about an estimation. Every option has a
default, and the defaults are meant to be used: `estimate(problem)` is the
normal call.

Options are given by keyword, either directly or through this struct:

```julia
estimate(problem; seed = 1, progress = true)

options = EstimationOptions(seed = 1, progress = true)
estimate(problem, options)
```

The options most people reach for come first. The rest adjust one stage of the
method each, and are grouped by stage.

# Everyday options

- `interpolators`: the curve fits used to estimate derivatives of the data, as
  a vector such as `[InterpolatorAAAD]`. Each is run and their candidate
  solutions are pooled. The default is nine methods: Gaussian processes,
  rational approximations and Chebyshev series. A shorter list is faster.
- `polish_solutions` (default `false`): refine each solution by least squares
  against the data. Worth turning on for noisy data.
- `opt_lb`, `opt_ub` (default `nothing`): lower and upper bounds, as vectors
  with the states first and then the parameters. Refinement stays inside them.
- `seed` (default `nothing`): with an integer, repeated runs give identical
  results and Julia's default random number generator is left as it was. With
  `nothing`, random draws come from the default generator, so results vary a
  little from run to run unless you call `Random.seed!` first.
- `progress` (default `false`): print one timestamped line as each stage starts
  and finishes.
- `shooting_points` (default `12`): how many time points the equations are
  solved at. Fewer is faster.
- `compute_uncertainty` (default `false`): also estimate standard errors for
  the best solution. Needs `InterpolatorAGPUQ` in `interpolators`.
- `abstol`, `reltol` (default `1e-14`): tolerances for simulating the model.

# Simulated data

These are read only by [`sample_problem_data`](@ref).

- `datasize` (default `21`): the number of time points.
- `time_interval` (default `[-0.5, 0.5]`): the first and last time.
- `noise_level` (default `0.0`): the size of the Gaussian noise added.
- `noise_model` (default `:additive`): with `:additive`, the noise has standard
  deviation `noise_level` times the mean absolute value of the series. With
  `:relative`, each value is multiplied by `1 + noise_level * randn()`.
- `uneven_sampling` (default `false`), `uneven_sampling_times`: sample at these
  times, of which there must be `datasize`, instead of on an even grid.
- `ode_solver` (default `AutoVern9(Rodas5P())`): the ODE solver for the
  simulation.

# Output

- `nooutput` (default `true`): print nothing and pass only errors to the
  logger. `false` prints the stages and a summary of the results.
- `diagnostics` (default `false`): print detailed diagnostics and write the
  candidate-synthesis log under `artifacts/diagnostics/`.
- `save_system` (default `false`), `save_filepath` (default `""`): save the
  polynomial systems to files, under `save_filepath` or else `saved_systems/`.
- `heartbeat` (default `true`): with `nooutput = false`, include the stage
  lines that `progress` prints.
- `profile_phases` (default `false`): print the time and memory each stage
  took.
- `debug_solver`, `debug_cas_diagnostics`, `debug_dimensional_analysis`
  (default `false`): extra output from the solver and the equation builder.
- `hc_show_progress` (default `false`): show HomotopyContinuation's progress
  bar.
- `dump_raw_candidates_path`, `dump_polished_path` (default `nothing`): write
  the candidate solutions to these CSV files, before and after refinement.

# Estimating derivatives

- `custom_interpolators` (default `Function[]`): your own functions
  `(times, values) -> curve`, one for each `InterpolatorCustom` entry in
  `interpolators`, in order.
- `auto_filter_interpolators` (default `true`): leave out the rational
  interpolators when the data look noisy, because they amplify noise.
- `s3_adapt_k` (default `10.0`): noise multiplier for the tolerance of the
  `InterpolatorS3Adapt` methods. Higher keeps fewer support points.
- `gp_derivative_lengthscale_factor` (default `1.0`): multiplies the fitted
  length scale of `InterpolatorAGPUQ`. Values below one smooth less.
- `gp_s3_refinement` (default `false`): deprecated. List the
  `InterpolatorS3Adapt` methods in `interpolators` instead.

# Building and solving the equations

- `flow` (default `FlowStandard`): `FlowStandard` is the algebraic method.
  `FlowDirectOpt` fits by local optimization alone.
- `system_solver` (default `SolverHC`): how the polynomial systems are solved.
  `SolverHC` is homotopy continuation, which finds every solution. `SolverNLOpt`,
  `SolverFastNLOpt` and `SolverRobust` are local solvers.
- `use_si_template` (default `true`): build the equations with
  StructuralIdentifiability.jl.
- `si_probability` (default `0.99`): the probability with which the
  identifiability analysis is correct.
- `si_fix_strategy` (default `:local_basis`): how values are chosen for
  quantities that cannot be determined: `:local_basis` or
  `:identifiable_functions`.
- `si_placeholder_fail_categories` (default `Symbol[]`): for development. Kinds
  of unresolved variable in the equations that should raise an error.
- `system_construction_policy` (default `:noise_frontier`): which equations
  are used. `:noise_frontier` prefers systems that need lower derivatives of
  the data and have fewer solutions. `:legacy` is the earlier choice.
- `construction_candidate_limit` (default `64`), `construction_beam_width`
  (default `16`), `construction_compute_mixed_volume` (default `true`): limits
  on the search that `:noise_frontier` does.
- `shooting_warp` (default `true`), `shooting_warp_beta` (default `3.0`):
  place more of the `shooting_points` near the start of the data, and how
  strongly.
- `point_hint` (default `0.5`): where in the time range, from 0 to 1, to work
  when a single time point is needed, as for uncertainty.
- `use_multipoint` (default `true`), `multipoint_n_points` (default `2`),
  `multipoint_max_pairs` (default `20`), `multipoint_pair_strategy` (default
  `:spread`): also solve systems that combine equations from several time
  points. The strategy is `:spread` or `:boundary_order`.
- `auto_handle_transcendentals` (default `true`): rewrite `sin(c*t)`,
  `cos(c*t)` and `exp(c*t)` in polynomial form.
- `auto_rescale` (default `true`): rescale states, parameters and data by
  powers of two to bring them near one, and convert the estimates back.
- `use_parameter_homotopy` (default `true`): solve at one time point and track
  the solutions to the others, which is faster than solving each afresh.
- `homotopy_tracking_mode` (default `:generic_start`): how that tracking is
  done: `:generic_start`, `:gamma_straight`, `:gamma_straight_fallback` or
  `:parameter`.
- `gamma_max_seeds` (default `5`), `gamma_seed` (default `0`): the number of
  random restarts for the tracking, and their seed. `0` uses a fixed seed for
  each problem, a positive value is used as given, and a negative value draws a
  new one every run, which `seed` cannot make repeatable.
- `use_column_scaling` (default `true`): scale the unknowns of each polynomial
  system by the size of the data derivatives.
- `hc_real_tol` (default `1e-9`): how small the imaginary part of a solution
  must be for it to count as real.
- `hc_threading` (default `true`), `hc_compile_mode` (default `:all`): passed
  to HomotopyContinuation: whether to use threads, and whether to compile the
  systems (`:all`, `:none` or `:mixed`).

# Choosing the solutions to return

- `algebraic_multiplicity` (default `nothing`), `compute_algebraic_multiplicity`
  (default `true`): the number of solutions the equations have. It is worked
  out automatically unless you set it. At most this many results are returned.
- `branch_top_k` (default `20`): the most results returned when that number is
  not known. `0` returns all of them.
- `rank_strategy` (default `:err_only`): the order of the results. `:err_only`
  is by fit error. `:sat_neg1_err`, `:sat_err`, `:lognorm_err` and
  `:lognorm_neg1_err` are experimental alternatives.
- `branch_detection` (default `true`): rank without using the true values.
  `false` ranks by distance to them, which is only meaningful in a benchmark.
- `clustering_threshold` (default `1e-5`): the relative distance below which
  two candidates are the same solution.
- `cluster_method` (default `:identifiable_subspace`), `rough_cluster_eps`
  (default `1.0`), `subspace_cluster_eps` (default `0.05`): how near-duplicates
  are merged. `:identifiable_subspace` first separates candidates that are far
  apart, then merges close ones within each group, at these two distances.
  `:bit_identical` merges only at `clustering_threshold`.
- `branch_cluster_eps` (default `0.001`), `branch_err_factor` (default
  `100.0`): before refinement, drop candidates whose fit error is more than
  `branch_err_factor` times the best, and merge the rest at this distance.
- `branch_diversity_selection` (default `true`), `branch_diversity_eps`
  (default `0.01`): when several results are returned, prefer ones that differ
  by at least this relative distance.
- `branch_completion` (default `true`), `branch_completion_max_anchors`
  (default `1`), `branch_completion_residual_tol` (default `1e-6`): when the
  equations have several solutions, take the best one found and solve for the
  others from it.
- `synthesize_aggregate_candidates` (default `true`): add candidates made by
  combining the others: the median, mean and trimmed mean of each value.

# Refining solutions

- `polish_solver_solutions` (default `true`): refine each solution of the
  polynomial equations against those equations.
- `polish_solver_jacobian` (default `:forwarddiff`), `polish_solver_chunk_size`
  (default `1`): how the Jacobian for that is computed, `:forwarddiff`,
  `:symbolic` or `:finitediff`, and ForwardDiff's chunk size, where `0` chooses
  automatically.
- `polish_method` (default `PolishLSOBoundedLog`): the optimizer for
  `polish_solutions`. `PolishLSOBoundedLog` and `PolishFastLMBoundedLog` are
  Levenberg–Marquardt methods. `PolishNewtonTrust`, `PolishBFGS` and
  `PolishLBFGS` minimize the sum of squares directly.
- `polish_maxiters` (default `100`), `polish_maxtime` (default `3600.0`
  seconds), `polish_max_concurrency` (default `Threads.nthreads()`): limits on
  the iterations and time spent on each solution, and on how many are refined
  at once.
- `polish_divergence_factor` (default `10.0`), `polish_stagnation_window`
  (default `50`): stop when the loss has grown by this factor, or has not
  improved for this many iterations.
- `polish_ode_maxiters` (default `5000`): the step limit for the ODE solver
  during refinement.
- `polish_coordinate_policy` (default `:auto`): the coordinates refinement
  works in. `:auto` takes logarithms of quantities whose bounds are positive.
  The others are `:linear`, `:log_only` and `:shifted_log_only`.
- `polish_regularization_lambda` (default `0.0`): the strength of an L2 penalty
  in those coordinates.
- `polish_softwall_lambda` (default `1e-2`), `polish_softwall_epsilon` (default
  `0.10`): a penalty that keeps values off their bounds: its strength, and the
  width of the band beside each bound where it acts, as a fraction of the
  range.
- `polish_lso_delta` (default `10.0`), `polish_lso_x_tol`, `polish_lso_f_tol`,
  `polish_lso_g_tol` (default `-1.0`): the trust-region radius and tolerances
  of the Levenberg–Marquardt methods. A negative tolerance means `abstol` or
  `reltol`.
- `opt_maxiters` (default `10000`): the iteration limit for the local
  optimization of `FlowDirectOpt` and `terminal_fallback`.
- `opt_ad_backend` (default `:forward`): how the optimizers get derivatives:
  `:forward` for ForwardDiff or `:finite` for finite differences.
- `terminal_fallback` (default `:direct_opt`): what to do when the algebraic
  method finds nothing. `:direct_opt` fits by local optimization. `:none`
  returns no results.
- `backsolve_recovery` (default `:algebraic_resolve`): what to do when a
  solution blows up as it is integrated back to the first time point.
  `:algebraic_resolve` keeps its parameters and solves for the states at that
  time again. `:none` does nothing.
- `t0_state_completion` (default `:strict`): with `:seed_for_polish`, when
  that recovery finds no states it supplies starting values for
  `polish_solutions` instead. With `:strict` it does not.
- `use_sensitivity_seeds` (default `false`), `sensitivity_seed_probe_scale`
  (default `1.0`), `sensitivity_seed_eigenvalue_threshold` (default `0.01`),
  `sensitivity_seed_mahalanobis_threshold` (default `-1.0`),
  `sensitivity_sigma_d_kappa` (default `2.0`): experimental. Add starting
  points for refinement along the directions in which the data constrain a
  solution least.

# Uncertainty

- `uq_failure_policy` (default `:return_failed`): when standard errors cannot
  be computed, `:return_failed` returns a [`UQUnavailable`](@ref) that says
  why, and `:throw` raises an error.
- `uq_noise_source` (default `:learned_gp_homoscedastic`): where the noise
  level comes from: the Gaussian process fit, or with `:smoother_residual_edf`
  the residuals of that fit.

	# `err` metric — candidate `err` was computed in two incompatible units

	# so cross-source comparisons were apples-vs-oranges and the `saturation`/`is_untagged`
	# keys were a band-aid for an untrustworthy residual. That was unified to SSE in 2026-06
	# (commit b543946). With `err` now ONE consistent unit, the 2026-06-12 ranking study
	# (`repro/ranking_study_2026_06_12/`) found the lowest-`err` candidate is the truth-near
	# one in EVERY M1 "matter" cell at 1em6 — `:err_only`, the full production
	# `:sat_neg1_err` path, and every other scheme give IDENTICAL 10/10 top-1 capture (even
	# when truth-near rows are only 3/244 of the pool). So the simplest honest scheme is the
