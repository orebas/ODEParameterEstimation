	_precompile_workload() -> Vector{ParameterEstimationResult}

Estimate a small model the way the README does: build the problem from a
ModelingToolkit system, simulate exact data, call `estimate` with no options
and display a result.

The model has two measured states and four parameters, the size of the README
example, because part of the refinement is compiled for the number of unknowns.
It is a different model, so that the README example is a fair test of what the
workload saves on a model it has not seen. `estimate` is called without
keywords because a keyword call is compiled for its particular set of
keywords.
