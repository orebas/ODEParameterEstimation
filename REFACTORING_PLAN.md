# ODEParameterEstimation.jl Refactoring Plan

## Current Status

We've analyzed the codebase and identified several areas for improvement:

1. **Debugging Code**: Numerous debug print statements that should be converted to proper logging
2. **Large Functions**: Several functions exceed 100 lines and handle multiple responsibilities
3. **Repeated Code**: Multiple patterns appear repeatedly and could be extracted
4. **API Inconsistencies**: Inconsistent parameter naming and function styles
5. **Code Organization**: Large files with mixed concerns

We've created comprehensive unit tests for key utility functions, but are currently experiencing issues running them. These tests provide a foundation to ensure our refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.

## Refactoring Priorities

### 1. Implement Proper Logging System

Replace all debug print statements with a proper logging system:
```julia
using Logging

# Instead of:
println("DEBUG [multipoint_parameter_estimation]: Parameter estimation using this many points: $good_num_points")

# Use:
@debug "Parameter estimation using this many points: $good_num_points"
```

### 2. Break Up Large Functions

1. Split `multipoint_parameter_estimation` (272 lines) into smaller functions:
   - `setup_parameter_estimation`: Handles setup and configuration
   - `solve_parameter_estimation`: Handles the core solution process
   - `process_estimation_results`: Handles post-processing and result conversion

2. Split `solve_with_rs` (134 lines) into:
   - `prepare_system_for_rs`: System preparation
   - `execute_rs_solver`: Core solution logic
   - `process_rs_results`: Result processing

### 3. Extract Helper Functions for Repeated Code

1. Create helper for derivatives calculation:
```julia
function calculate_higher_derivatives(DD, max_level)
    # Extracted code for derivative calculation
end
```

2. Create helper for debug/logging output:
```julia
function log_equations(logger, title, equations)
    # Extracted code for logging equations
end
```

### 4. Clean Up File Organization

1. Split `parameter_estimation.jl` into:
   - `parameter_estimation_core.jl`: Core estimation logic
   - `parameter_estimation_utils.jl`: Helper functions
   - `parameter_estimation_solvers.jl`: Different solver implementations

2. Reorganize `derivatives.jl` by concern:
   - `interpolation.jl`: Interpolation methods
   - `derivatives.jl`: Core derivative calculation logic
   - `approximation.jl`: Approximation methods

### 5. Standardize APIs and Naming

1. Standardize parameter types with explicit type annotations
2. Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for all functions)
3. Use consistent parameter names for similar concepts

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Logging System First**: This provides immediate clarity and reduces clutter
2. **Function Extraction Second**: Extract helper functions for repeated patterns
3. **Break Up Large Functions**: Split complex functions with well-defined interfaces
4. **File Reorganization Last**: Once the internals are cleaned up, reorganize files

Each step should be small and incremental, with validation that the code still works after each change.

## Testing Strategy

We've created comprehensive unit tests that should be used to validate each refactoring step. When automatic testing is challenging, we should use manual verification with specific examples.
