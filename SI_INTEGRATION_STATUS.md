# SI.jl Integration Status

## Current State
- ✅ Added StructuralIdentifiability.jl dependency to Project.toml
- ✅ Created si_equation_builder.jl with conversion functions
- ✅ Created si_template_integration.jl for template-based equation construction
- ✅ Modified construct_multipoint_equation_system! to use SI.jl template by default
- ✅ Added use_si_template parameter (default true) to switch between SI.jl and iterative paths

## Architecture
The integration follows a template-based approach:
1. SI.jl generates a polynomial template ONCE at the beginning
2. This template contains equations with derivative variables (y', y'', etc.)
3. For each shooting point, we substitute interpolated values into the template
4. This avoids repeating the expensive symbolic analysis

## Key Functions
- `get_si_equation_system()`: Gets polynomial template from SI.jl
- `convert_to_si_ode()`: Converts ODESystem to SI.jl's ODE format
- `construct_equation_system_from_si_template()`: Drop-in replacement for iterative construction
- `nemo_to_symbolics()`: Converts Nemo polynomials back to Symbolics expressions

## Current Issues
### Precompilation Timeout
- The package hangs during precompilation after adding StructuralIdentifiability.jl
- This appears to be due to heavy dependencies (Oscar, Nemo, AbstractAlgebra)
- These packages have complex interdependencies and long compilation times

### Potential Solutions
1. **Conditional Loading**: Load SI.jl only when needed using Requires.jl
2. **Separate Package**: Move SI.jl integration to an extension package
3. **Wait for Compilation**: The timeout might just need to be longer (>10 minutes)
4. **Version Resolution**: Resolve version conflicts between packages

## Implementation Details
The SI.jl integration replaces the iterative equation construction that:
- Works 90% of the time with the current approach
- Expected to work 100% with SI.jl's robust symbolic analysis

The key insight is that both approaches produce the same thing:
- A template with derivative variables on the LHS
- These get substituted with interpolated values at specific time points
- SI.jl just generates this template more robustly

## Next Steps
1. Resolve precompilation issues
2. Test with simple models
3. Verify multipoint shooting works correctly
4. Test on all example models
5. Performance comparison with iterative approach
