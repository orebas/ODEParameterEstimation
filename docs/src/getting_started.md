# Getting started

This page fits a model to data from start to finish. Allow five minutes, most
of them Julia compiling.

## Installing

You need Julia 1.12 or later. The package is not in the General registry yet,
so add it from GitHub, along with ModelingToolkit, which models are written in:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/orebas/ODEParameterEstimation.jl")
Pkg.add("ModelingToolkit")
```

## The whole thing

```@example start
using ODEParameterEstimation, ModelingToolkit
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t, D_nounits as D

# A predator-prey model with four unknown rates.
@parameters α β γ δ
@variables prey(t) predators(t) y1(t) y2(t)
@named lotka_volterra = System([
    D(prey) ~ α * prey - β * prey * predators,
    D(predators) ~ δ * prey * predators - γ * predators,
], t)

# Both populations were counted. Here the counts are simulated from known values.
problem = ParameterEstimationProblem(lotka_volterra, [y1 ~ prey, y2 ~ predators];
    true_values = [α => 1.1, β => 0.4, γ => 0.4, δ => 0.1, prey => 1.0, predators => 0.5])
problem = sample_problem_data(problem; datasize = 101, time_interval = [0.0, 10.0])

results = estimate(problem)
results[1]
```

The estimates are the values the data were simulated from. No starting guess
was given for any of them, and no bounds.

## What each part does

**The model** is an ordinary ModelingToolkit `System`. `t` is time and `D` is
the derivative with respect to it. If you have a model written for simulation
with ModelingToolkit, you can pass that same system.

**The measured quantities**, `[y1 ~ prey, y2 ~ predators]`, say what was
observed. Each left-hand side is a name you choose for one series of
measurements. Each right-hand side says what that series measures. It does not
have to be a single state: if only the total number of animals had been
counted, you would write `[y ~ prey + predators]`.

**The data** here come from [`sample_problem_data`](@ref), which simulates the
model with the `true_values` and records the measured quantities at 101 times.
With real measurements you skip both and pass the numbers themselves:

```julia
problem = ParameterEstimationProblem(lotka_volterra, [y1 ~ prey, y2 ~ predators];
    data = (t = times, y1 = prey_counts, y2 = predator_counts))
```

**[`estimate`](@ref)** returns a vector of results, best fit first. There is
usually one. [More than one answer](@ref) explains when there are several.

The first call in a Julia session takes a couple of minutes, because Julia
compiles the package for your model. Calling it again takes seconds.

## Reading the result

A result prints its values, and you can take them out one at a time or all
together:

```@example start
best = results[1]
best[α]
```

```@example start
best.parameters
```

`best.states` holds the initial conditions in the same form. Both are
dictionaries keyed by the symbols of your model.

## Seeing the fit

To see how well an estimate explains the data, simulate the model with it and
draw both. This is plain ModelingToolkit,
[OrdinaryDiffEq](https://docs.sciml.ai/OrdinaryDiffEq/stable/) and
[Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/), which you may need to add first:

```@example start
using OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots

fitted = solve(ODEProblem(mtkcompile(lotka_volterra), merge(best.states, best.parameters), (0.0, 10.0)), Tsit5())

data = problem.data_sample   # the simulated measurements
scatter(data["t"], [data[prey] data[predators]]; label = ["prey, measured" "predators, measured"], markersize = 2)
plot!(fitted; idxs = [prey, predators], label = ["prey, fitted" "predators, fitted"], xlabel = "time")
```

## Where next

- [Your own data](@ref): vectors, tables, and series measured at different times.
- [Noisy data](@ref): what to expect when the measurements are not exact, and
  what helps.
- [More than one answer](@ref): models where the data allow several parameter
  sets, or leave some parameters open.
- [Which models work](@ref): the kinds of equations the method can handle.
