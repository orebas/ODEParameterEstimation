# Noisy data

Measured data are noisy, and noise is hard on the equation-solving part of this
method, because it works from derivatives of the data and differentiating
amplifies noise. So `estimate` does not stop there. It takes each solution of
the equations and fits it to the data by least squares. This page shows what
each step contributes.

## An example

The predator-prey model again, with 101 measurements of each population.
Noise has been added to them, with a standard deviation of 2% of each
population's average size:

```@example noisy
using ODEParameterEstimation, ModelingToolkit
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t, D_nounits as D

@parameters α β γ δ
@variables prey(t) predators(t) y1(t) y2(t)
@named lotka_volterra = System([
    D(prey) ~ α * prey - β * prey * predators,
    D(predators) ~ δ * prey * predators - γ * predators,
], t)

truth = [α => 1.1, β => 0.4, γ => 0.4, δ => 0.1, prey => 1.0, predators => 0.5]
problem = ParameterEstimationProblem(lotka_volterra, [y1 ~ prey, y2 ~ predators]; true_values = truth)
problem = sample_problem_data(problem;
    datasize = 101, time_interval = [0.0, 10.0], noise_level = 0.02, seed = 1)
nothing # hide
```

Here is the estimate, and beside it what the equations gave before the fit,
which `polish_solutions = false` returns:

```@example noisy
refined = estimate(problem; seed = 1)[1]
rough = estimate(problem; seed = 1, polish_solutions = false)[1]

println("              true     rough   refined")
for (quantity, value) in truth
    println(rpad(quantity, 13), rpad(value, 9), rpad(round(rough[quantity]; sigdigits = 3), 8), round(refined[quantity]; sigdigits = 3))
end
```

The rough values come from derivatives of noisy data. They are in the right
region, and some are well off. The refined ones started there and were then
fitted to the data, and they are within a few percent of the truth.

```@example noisy
using OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots

fit = solve(ODEProblem(mtkcompile(lotka_volterra), merge(refined.states, refined.parameters), (0.0, 10.0)), Tsit5())

data = problem.data_sample
scatter(data["t"], [data[prey] data[predators]]; label = ["prey, measured" "predators, measured"], markersize = 2)
plot!(fit; idxs = [prey, predators], label = ["prey, fitted" "predators, fitted"], xlabel = "time")
```

## Why two steps

Fitting by least squares is the standard way to estimate parameters, and its
weakness is that it has to start near the answer. Solving the equations
supplies that start, and because it finds every solution, the fit begins in the
right place each time.

On exact data the solutions of the equations are already exact, and the fit
leaves them as they are.

## What else helps

- **More points.** The fit averages the noise over all of them, so more points
  mean a better answer.
- **Bounds.** If you know the values are positive, or lie in some range, pass
  `opt_lb` and `opt_ub`. See [Options](@ref).
- **Measuring more.** A model whose unknowns all show up in the first or second
  derivative of the data gives a far better start than one that needs the
  fifth. Measuring one more state can make that difference.

A run on noisy data can be made faster by using a single Gaussian-process
interpolator, which here gives the same answer:

```julia
estimate(problem; interpolators = [InterpolatorAGPRobust])
```

## How good is the answer

Plot it, as above. For a number, there is an experimental way to estimate a
standard error for each parameter. See [Uncertainty](@ref).
