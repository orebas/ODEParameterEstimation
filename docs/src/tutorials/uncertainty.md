# Uncertainty

With noisy data an estimate is only good to within some margin. The package
can estimate that margin, as a standard error for each parameter and initial
condition.

```@example uq
using ODEParameterEstimation, ModelingToolkit
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t, D_nounits as D

@parameters a b
@variables x1(t) x2(t) y1(t) y2(t)
@named oscillator = System([D(x1) ~ -a * x2, D(x2) ~ b * x1], t)

problem = ParameterEstimationProblem(oscillator, [y1 ~ x1, y2 ~ x2];
    true_values = [a => 0.4, b => 0.8, x1 => 1.0, x2 => 0.5])
problem = sample_problem_data(problem;
    datasize = 101, time_interval = [0.0, 5.0], noise_level = 0.01, seed = 1)
nothing # hide
```

Two options turn it on. `compute_uncertainty = true` asks for it.
`InterpolatorAGPUQ` is the curve fit that makes it possible: a Gaussian process
that estimates the noise in the data along with the curve. The uncertainty
comes back as the third value of [`analyze_parameter_estimation_problem`](@ref):

```@example uq
options = EstimationOptions(interpolators = [InterpolatorAGPUQ], compute_uncertainty = true, seed = 1)
raw, analysis, uncertainty = analyze_parameter_estimation_problem(problem, options)

for (name, value, standard_error) in zip(uncertainty.param_labels, uncertainty.estimate_values, uncertainty.param_std)
    println(rpad(name, 4), round(value; sigdigits = 4), " ± ", round(standard_error; sigdigits = 2))
end
```

The data were simulated with `a = 0.4`, `b = 0.8`, `x1 = 1` and `x2 = 0.5`, and
each estimate is within a standard error or two of its true value.

`uncertainty.param_covariance` is the full covariance matrix, and
`print_uncertainty_results(uncertainty)` prints a longer report.

## What the numbers mean

The Gaussian process learns how noisy the data are. That noise is then carried
through the least-squares fit to the parameters, using a linear approximation
around the estimate. The standard errors say how far the estimate would move if
the same experiment were measured again with fresh noise.

Keep three things in mind:

- They belong to the first result. If the model has several answers, they say
  nothing about the others.
- They rest on a linear approximation. With little noise it is good. With a lot
  of noise, or a model that reacts sharply to its parameters, treat them as a
  guide to the size of the error, not as exact confidence intervals.
- They assume the model is right. If it does not describe the system, small
  standard errors do not make the estimates meaningful.

## When it cannot be computed

If the uncertainty cannot be worked out, the third value is a `UQUnavailable`
in place of a report, and its `message` says why:

```julia
if uncertainty isa UncertaintyReport
    uncertainty.param_std
else
    println(uncertainty.message)
end
```

A report also carries its own checks. `uncertainty.status` is `:ok` when they
passed, and `uncertainty.warnings` lists the assumptions behind the numbers.
