### 4. **model_utils.jl** (+4 lines, -1 line)
**Minor Changes:**
- Convert Dict to OrderedDict in `generate_derivatives()` function
- Ensures consistent ordering of derivatives across operations

### 5. **multipoint_estimation.jl** (+8 lines, -1 line)  
**Minor Changes:**
- Updated to use OrderedDict for parameter storage
- Added debug logging for multipoint estimation
- Improved parameter ordering consistency in multipoint scenarios

### 6. **sampling.jl** (+2 lines, -1 line)
**Minor Changes:**
- Convert Dict to OrderedDict in sampling operations
- Ensures deterministic sampling behavior

## Overall Assessment

### How These Changes Fix the Dict Ordering Bug:
1. **Root Cause**: Julia's Dict type doesn't guarantee insertion order, causing parameters to be processed in random order
2. **Solution**: Systematic replacement with OrderedDict ensures deterministic, reproducible parameter ordering
3. **Impact**: This fixes incorrect identifiability assessments where parameter order affected algebraic computations

### Key Improvements:
- **Reproducibility**: Results are now deterministic across runs
- **Debugging**: Extensive logging helps diagnose issues in polynomial solving
- **Robustness**: Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Persistence**: System state can be saved/loaded for debugging
- **Numerical Stability**: Improved rationalization and type handling

### Breaking Changes:
- None identified - changes maintain API compatibility while fixing internal ordering issues

### Technical Debt Addressed:
- Removed brittle random hyperplane addition in favor of systematic approaches
- Improved type safety in polynomial conversions
- Better separation of concerns between symbolic and algebraic computations
