# API Improvements Summary

## Successfully Implemented Changes

### 1. Interpolation Framework
- Created an `AbstractInterpolator` abstract type as the base for all interpolators
- Updated existing interpolators to inherit from this type:
  - `AAADapprox` for AAA rational approximation
  - `GPRapprox` for Gaussian Process Regression 
  - `FHDapprox` for Floater-Hormann interpolation
  - `FourierSeries` for Fourier series interpolation
- Added specific method for `nth_deriv_at` to handle all interpolator types
- Exported all relevant interpolator types and functions
- Created a test script that validates the interpolation framework
- Results showed excellent accuracy in both interpolation and derivatives

### 2. Type System Improvements
- Updated core type definitions with more specific types where possible:
  - `OrderedODESystem`: Added concrete type annotations
  - `ParameterEstimationProblem`: Updated types while maintaining compatibility
  - `ParameterEstimationResult`: Added Union types to allow for both explicit and legacy behaviors
  - `DerivativeData`: Preserved flexibility while improving documentation
- Made type annotations more generic in functions with mixed input types
- Fixed conversion issues between `Num` and `SymbolicUtils.BasicSymbolic{Real}` types

### 3. Function Signatures
- Added explicit return types to key functions:
  - `nth_deriv_at`: Added proper return type and parameter specifications
  - `convert_to_real_or_complex_array`: Explicitly defined union return type
  - `lookup_value`: Added Float64 return type
  - `create_interpolants`: Added proper return type annotation
- Standardized parameter names across related functions:
  - Changed `rtol`/`atol` to `reltol`/`abstol` consistently
  - Used `interp_func` instead of `interpolator` for clarity

### 4. Documentation
- Added comprehensive docstrings to all modified functions
- Standardized docstring format for consistency
- Added type information in parameter descriptions
- Added cross-references between related functions

## Benefits

1. **Type Stability**: The changes improve type inference in several key areas, which should lead to better performance and fewer runtime errors.

2. **API Consistency**: By standardizing parameter names and function signatures, we've made the codebase more predictable and easier to use.

3. **Extensibility**: The AbstractInterpolator pattern makes it easier to add new interpolation methods in the future.

4. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings make the codebase more approachable and reduce the learning curve.

## Next Steps

To complete the API improvements, we should:

1. Continue applying the same patterns to other core components
2. Create more comprehensive tests for each component
3. Add type-stability optimizations for performance-critical functions
4. Implement the incremental strategy outlined in API_STABILIZATION_PLAN.md
