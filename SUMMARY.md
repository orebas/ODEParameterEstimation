# ODEParameterEstimation.jl Summary

ODEParameterEstimation.jl is a Julia package for inferring parameters of differential equation systems from observed data. The package implements sophisticated numerical techniques for parameter estimation in ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, focusing on systems biology and other scientific applications.

## Core Functionality

1. **Parameter Estimation**: The package can estimate parameters of ODE systems from time-series data using several approaches:
   - Multi-point homotopy continuation-based parameter estimation
   - Local identifiability analysis
   - Multi-shooting parameter estimation methods

2. **Identifiability Analysis**: The code analyzes which parameters can be uniquely determined from the available data, and automatically handles non-identifiable parameters.

3. **Numerical Techniques**:
   - Derivative computation through interpolation methods
   - Polynomial system solving via homotopy continuation
   - Rational Systems (RS) solver implementation
   - Solution polishing via local optimization

4. **Model Structure**: The package utilizes ModelingToolkit.jl for symbolic manipulation of ODE systems and handles:
   - Conversion between different model representations
   - Automatic derivatives of observable equations
   - Symbolic substitution for unidentifiable parameters

## Key Features

- Preserves ordering of parameters and state variables
- Handles non-identifiable parameters automatically
- Supports arbitrary nonlinear ODE systems
- Works with partial observations (not all state variables need to be measured)
- Implements multiple methods for derivative estimation from noisy data
- Supports a variety of ODE solvers from DifferentialEquations.jl
- Provides analysis tools to evaluate estimation quality

This package is designed for scientific applications where determining parameter values from experimental data is crucial, particularly in cases where traditional optimization-based approaches may struggle with complex nonlinear systems.
