# Pre-Merge Summary: new-workflow-testing → main

## Overview
Created `pre-merge-workflow` branch to safely integrate valuable components from the experimental `new-workflow-testing` branch while maintaining the improvements already made in main.

## Files Added
1. **src/core/optimized_multishot_estimation.jl** (1263 lines)
   - Implements optimized parameter estimation with precomputed derivatives
   - Key features:
     - `PrecomputedDerivatives` struct for caching symbolic derivatives
     - `EquationTemplate` for reusable equation systems
     - Adaptive identifiability analysis with RUR feedback
     - `optimized_multishot_parameter_estimation` as drop-in replacement

2. **src/core/robust_conversion.jl** (406 lines)
   - Provides robust AbstractAlgebra conversion utilities
   - Key features:
     - `safe_variable_name()` - Handles special characters in variable names
     - `robust_exprs_to_AA_polys()` - Robust conversion to AbstractAlgebra
     - `solve_with_rs_new()` - Enhanced RUR solver with polishing

## Key Improvements Applied

### 1. Code Quality Fixes
- ✅ Replaced all `substitute` with `Symbolics.substitute` (8 instances)
- ✅ Replaced all `Dict` with `OrderedDict` for consistent ordering (16 instances)
- ✅ Added debug gating to all println statements (71 wrapped with debug flags)

### 2. Debug Infrastructure
Added three debug flags that propagate through the call stack:
- `debug_solver` - General solver debugging
- `debug_cas_diagnostics` - Computer algebra system diagnostics
- `debug_dimensional_analysis` - Dimensional analysis output

### 3. Eliminated Code Duplication
- Removed duplicate PolynomialRoots logic
- Now using `robust_exprs_to_AA_polys` consistently instead of old conversion
- Consolidated root finding into shared functions

### 4. Module Integration
- Added includes in ODEParameterEstimation.jl
- Exported new functions:
  - `optimized_multishot_parameter_estimation`
  - `solve_with_rs_new`
  - `robust_exprs_to_AA_polys`

## Testing Status
- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Git commits clean
- ⏳ Full package precompilation pending (takes time due to dependencies)
- ⏳ Runtime testing pending

## Next Steps for Full Merge

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete runtime testing with example problems
2. Verify both workflows (old and optimized) produce comparable results
3. Performance benchmarking of optimized vs standard workflow

### Future Improvements
1. Further consolidate AbstractAlgebra conversion logic
2. Add comprehensive tests for robust_conversion functions
3. Document the optimized workflow API
4. Consider making optimized workflow the default if benchmarks are favorable

## Known Issues
- Precompilation is slow due to heavy dependencies (Oscar, Singular, etc.)
- Complex solutions handling still uses real part (documented limitation)

## Branch Status
- Current branch: `pre-merge-workflow`
- Ready for testing and review
- Can be merged to main after validation

## Migration Path
Users can gradually adopt the optimized workflow:
```julia
# Old workflow (still works)
results = multishot_parameter_estimation(problem)

# New optimized workflow (opt-in)
results = optimized_multishot_parameter_estimation(problem)
```

Both workflows coexist peacefully with shared infrastructure.
